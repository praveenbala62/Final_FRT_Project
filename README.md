# Future Ready Talent Project By Praveen Bala

I have created a website named NEOX using HTML, CSS and JavaScript it helps the customer to find correct style for them. Due to lack of style people feel different from others in the society this create depression in them and they might go through serious issue. So this project will help them in that aspect it will show the best updated style for that particular person. In the website I have added six sections that is Home, About, Services, Gallery, Dropdown, Contact. It is very well defined website where I have added all the factors that will help the customer with proper style sense.

# About My Project

## Industry Name: Lifestyle

## Project Title: Enhance your style website

## Problem Statement:

As we know that fashion and styling is a raging topic and many people find problems to choose correct style or fashion to update themselves with the society. So, I have created a website in that we will assist people with all the updated styling or fashion that one need to follow and the best styling possible for that person. Sometime people get depressed for feel leftover due to lack of proper style, so this will help them to make them feel special and to not feel like a leftover person. So this might alternatively decrease the depression part too.
